First, install required packages:
pip install tensorflow nltk pandas numpy scikit-learn

intents.json
First, create a training data file:

intents.json+36-1
tejuice_chatbot.py
Create the training script:

tejuice_chatbot.py+77-1
chatbot.py
Create the chatbot class:

chatbot.py

Update the chat view to use the ML chatbot:
views.py

Steps to implement:

Create the chatbot_model directory in your myapp folder
Save all the files in their respective locations
Install required packages
Run the training script once to generate the model:
cd chatbot/myapp/chatbot_model
python tejuice_chatbot.py

This implementation includes:

Intent-based responses using neural networks
Natural language processing with NLTK
Conversation history storage in database
Common therapy-related intents
Response probability threshold
Lemmatization for better understanding
The chatbot will:

Understand user intent
Provide appropriate therapeutic responses
Remember conversation history
Handle common mental health topics
Give contextual responses
You can expand the intents.json file with more patterns and responses to make the chatbot more comprehensive.
