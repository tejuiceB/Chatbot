Currently:

Model starts with just 4 sample cases
Makes basic predictions based on these patterns:
LOW: Young age, low exposure, good vitals
MEDIUM: Middle age, moderate symptoms
HIGH: Older age, poor vitals, severe symptoms
To get real learning:

Add data to the database:
python manage.py init_model  # First time setup

After collecting real data (minimum 20 cases):
python manage.py train_model  # Train with real data

Monitor learning progress:
GET /api/miner-health/model_status/

To improve predictions:

Input at least 20 real cases
Get doctor feedback on predictions
Let model retrain with corrected data
System will gradually shift from default patterns to learned patterns
The model starts very basic but will improve as you add more real cases and doctor feedback.
